* Overview
** Tasks
*** DONE Given a task (id, center, left, right), display it
DEADLINE: <2020-02-25 Tue>
*** TODO Get an incomplete task for the user from firebase
DEADLINE: <2020-02-25 Tue>
*** TODO Write the result of a task to the database
DEADLINE: <2020-02-25 Tue>
**** TODO Make a form to submit the task annotation
*** TODO Assign tasks to users
DEADLINE: <2020-02-25 Tue>
**** [ ] Set user limits (min/max number of tasks) user must complete
**** [ ] Set min/max number of annotaters per task
**** [ ] When user requests a task, select a task that requires doing
weight by how many tasks are partially complete and how many are incomplete
*** Security
**** TODO Fix authentication to prevent people from deleting things randomly
- Users shouldn't be able to write anything directly
- Ideally, there is a ~getTaskForUID~ and ~submitAnnotation~ function
- https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/user-security
** Data Model
*** Task model
#+BEGIN_SRC js
var task = {
    task_id: "id",
    taskset: "name", //name of the task set released (subfolder on git)
    data: {
        type: "a_b_parse", //type of annotation task - defines template to render
        sentence: "sentence", //sentence in question
        reference: "url", //url of gold annotation
        first: "url", //url of first alternative
        second: "url", //url of second alternative
    },
    requirements: { //requirements are used as an ^ situation.  Put in as many or as few as desired
        coverage: 1, //number of annotators desired
        annotators: [], //annotator ids
        agreement: 0 // percentage of agreement required
    },
    annotations: ["ids"] // list of annotations performed
    is_active: true // whether the task is active
};
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC js
var taskset = {
    groups: [
        { type: "students", set: 0 }
    ],
    items: 4,
    type: "a_b_parse"
}
#+END_SRC
**** DONE get tripscli to output task json lists
DEADLINE: <2020-02-26 Wed>
**** TODO translate gold annotations from will's tool into task json lists
DEADLINE: <2020-02-26 Wed>
**** DONE upload tasks.  Reject multiple tasks with the same sentence (for now)
DEADLINE: <2020-02-26 Wed>
**** TODO retrieve a random task incomplete task  for testing purposes
DEADLINE: <2020-02-26 Wed>
*** Annotation model
#+BEGIN_SRC js
var annotation = {
    annotation_id: "id" // an id number for this annotation
    time: "<2020-02-26 Wed 04:22 EST>",
    user_id: "id",
    task_id: "id",
    annotation: { // any data that is considered an annotation
        closer: "first" // "second" | "same" | "neither"
    }
};
#+END_SRC
**** TODO Add annotation to database
DEADLINE: <2020-02-26 Wed>
***** TODO Add ~annotation_id~ to user and ~task~
**** TODO Ensure that task/annotator pair doesn't exist
DEADLINE: <2020-02-26 Wed>
**** TODO Return success or failure
*** User Model
#+BEGIN_SRC js
var user = {
    id: "id_number",
    groups: { type: "student", set: 0 }, // how the annoatator should be treated
    annotations: ["annotation_id"], // list of annotations
    queue: ["task_id"],
    limits: {
        min: 3, // minimum number of annotations required from user
        max: 10000, // maximum number of annotations allowed from user
        types: [] // if this list is populated and not empty, only allow task types listed within to be annotated by the user
    }
}

var group = { 0: ["test"] }; // a list of tasksets for each set
#+END_SRC
**** DONE Ensure that all this information is autopopulated
DEADLINE: <2020-02-26 Wed>
** Queries
*** Task allocation
When a user selects a task:
1. Select new task or partially fulfilled
2. Collect all tasks of that type
3. if an incomplete task for the user is available, return it
4. adjust probability of new/partial task as necessary to get things done
**** TODO Write query
DEADLINE: <2020-02-26 Wed>
*** Task Completion:
Form should write an annotation object, reject if annotation exists
*** [Extension] Dashboard
See previously completed annotations.  If desired an annotation could be deleted
from here
*** User has completed task
*** User has completed enough tasks
*** Estimate: Enough tasks exist
** Dashboard
*** Tasks
**** How many tasks exist
**** Display annotation
**** Annotator agreement
*** User
**** Tasks annotated
**** Annotator agreement (against all other annotators)
